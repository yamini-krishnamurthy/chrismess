* Use more than one function (break `changeHeading()` into different functions)

## Day 1 Homework

* Make the button change the text of the heading (the `<h1>`)

### Bonus Credit
* Add multiple headings to the page, and make the button change the second one. (Use a `class` or an `id`.)

### Super Mega Bonus Credit
* Add a form to the page.
* Add a text input to the form.
* When the form is *submitted*, update the heading with the text that you type in the text input.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting
* Make sure it works when you press *enter* on the keyboard, not just when you click the button.
