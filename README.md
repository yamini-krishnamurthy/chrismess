## Day 3 Homework
* In addition to building a list item, and adding it to the DOM (as we are now), also store each list item in an array

* Add a *delete* button to each list item that removes it from the list

### Super Mega Bonus Credit
* Remove the list item from the array as well

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting
* Add a "favorite" button to each flick as well that lets you mark your favorites
* Display favorites differently
* Be sure to that favorites are recorded in the array

## ~~Day 2 Homework~~
* Give the function a more accurate name of your choice
* Add a second field value to the form
* Display the value of that field to the list

### Bonus Credit
* Display the second field in a separate HTML element than the flick name
* See if you can then style each field differently

### Super Mega Bonus Credit
* Use more than one function (break `changeHeading()` into different functions)

## ~~Day 1 Homework~~

* Make the button change the text of the heading (the `<h1>`)

### Bonus Credit
* Add multiple headings to the page, and make the button change the second one. (Use a `class` or an `id`.)

### Super Mega Bonus Credit
* Add a form to the page.
* Add a text input to the form.
* When the form is *submitted*, update the heading with the text that you type in the text input.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting
* Make sure it works when you press *enter* on the keyboard, not just when you click the button.
